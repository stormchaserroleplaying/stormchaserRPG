# Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

## Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

The GM might also call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
* Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

## Spellcasting Ability
Disciples and mages can use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the attack bonus of spells that they cast.
