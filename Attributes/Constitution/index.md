# Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks
A Constitution check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Hold your breath
* March or labour for hours without rest
* Go without sleep
* Survive without food or water
* Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

## Stamina
In combination with your recovery die multiplier, your Constitution score determines your stamina maximum.

Your maximum stamina is determined by your Constitution score and [Recovery Die](https://github.com/stormchaserroleplaying/stormchaserRPG/blob/main/Talents/Die/Recovery/index.md#d6-recovery-die) size. At minimum, your stamina equals your Constitution score. Each time you increase your Recovery die size, your maximum stamina increases. If you are missing any stamina at that time, you stay at the same stamina amount.
