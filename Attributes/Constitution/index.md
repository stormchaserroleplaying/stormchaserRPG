# Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks
A Constitution check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Hold your breath
* March or labour for hours without rest
* Go without sleep
* Survive without food or water
* Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

## Stamina
Your maximum stamina is equal to your Constitution score multiplied a factor determined by your [Recovery Die](https://github.com/stormchaserroleplaying/stormchaserRPG/blob/main/Talents/Die/Recovery/index.md#d6-recovery-die). See below:

| Recovery Die | Stamina Multiplier |
|:------------:|:------------------:|
| d4 | ×1 |
| d6 | ×2 |
| d8 | ×3 |
| d10 | ×4 |
| d12 | ×5 |

If your Constitution score ever changes, then your stamina maximum changes as well. For example, if you increase your Constitution score from 13 to 14, then you gain 1 stamina multiplied by the factor from your [Recovery Die](https://github.com/stormchaserroleplaying/stormchaserRPG/blob/main/Talents/Die/Recovery/index.md#d6-recovery-die). If some effect lowers your Constitution score, then your stamina maximum is also reduced in kind.

Each time that you increase the size of your [Recovery Die](https://github.com/stormchaserroleplaying/stormchaserRPG/blob/main/Talents/Die/Recovery/index.md#d6-recovery-die), your maximum stamina increases. If you are missing any stamina at that time, then your stamina increases such that the difference between your current stamina and your maximum stamina remains the same.
