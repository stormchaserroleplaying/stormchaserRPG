# Attributes
Six attributes provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

**Strength**, measuring physical power,

**Dexterity**, measuring agility,

**Constitution**, measuring endurance,

**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning & memory,

**Wisdom**, measuring perception & insight,

**Charisma**, measuring force of personality.

|   | Physical | Mental |
|:-:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Power** | Strength | Charisma |
| **Finesse** | Dexterity | Intelligence |
| **Resistance** | Constitution | Wisdom |

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Attributes define these qualities. They are both a creature's assets and its weaknesses.

The two main rolls of the game (the attack roll and the skill check) rely on the six attributes. The introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six attributes, and compare the total to a target number.

This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways that they are used in the game.
