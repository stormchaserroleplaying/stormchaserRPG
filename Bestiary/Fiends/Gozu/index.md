**Speed:** 80 feet

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The gozu makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its slam.

**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* 2d20kh1+8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 2d12+8 piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the gozu can’t bite another target.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* 2d20kh1+8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3d8+8 bludgeoning damage.

**Swallow:** The gozu makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target that it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gozu, and it takes 6d6 acid damage at the start of each of the gozu's turns. If the gozu takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, then that creature may roll a d20 at the end of that turn. On a 10+ the gozu must regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the gozu. If the gozu dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

## Special Abilities
**Charge:** If the gozu moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 6d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature and the attack roll hits its Strength defence, then it is pushed up to 20 feet away from the gozu and knocked prone.

**Siege Monster:** The gozu deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Other
**Senses:** Darkvision (60 ft.), Passive Perception 10
