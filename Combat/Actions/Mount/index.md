# Mount
*Move*<br>
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.

You move onto the creature and ride it. If you're already mounted, you can instead use this action to dismount, moving off the mount into a space adjacent to it.
