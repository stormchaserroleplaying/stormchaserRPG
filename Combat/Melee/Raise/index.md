# Raise Shield
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** You are wielding an item with the shield property.

*You position your shield to protect yourself.*

When you have raised a shield, it takes the damage that melee and ranged attacks would deal to you (see [Breaking an Object](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Objects/#breaking-an-object)).

Your shield remains raised until the start of your next turn.
