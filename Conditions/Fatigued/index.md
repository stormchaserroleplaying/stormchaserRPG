# Fatigued
* A fatigued creature can only use the [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) action once per round and takes -1d for Strength and Dexterity skill checks. 
* Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue caused the fatigued creature to gain one level of [Exhaustion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Exhaustion/).
* Fatigued creatures can end the condition by completing a long rest.
