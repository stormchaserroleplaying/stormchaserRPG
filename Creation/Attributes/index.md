# 1. Choose Attributes
Start by generating your character's attributes. These six scores are your character's most basic statistics and are used to determine a wide variety of details and statistics.

Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six attributes: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** and **Charisma**. Each attribute has a score, which is a number that you record on your character sheet.

The six attributes and their use in the game are described in detail [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Attributes/). A quick reference for what qualities are measured by each attribute follows below:

* **Strength** measures athleticism and bodily power.
* **Dexterity** measures agility, reflexes, balance and poise.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina and vital force.
* **Intelligence** measures acuity, recall and analytical skill.
* **Wisdom** measures awareness, intuition and insight.
* **Charisma** measures confidence and eloquence.

|   | Physical | Mental |
|:-:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Power** | Strength | Charisma |
| **Finesse** | Dexterity | Intelligence |
| **Resistance** | Constitution | Wisdom |

[Species](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Species/) and [background](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Origins/Backgrounds/) modifiers are applied after the scores are generated.

After assigning your attributes, determine your attribute modifiers using the table below. To determine an attribute modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the attribute and then divide the result by 2 (round down).

| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 1 | −5 |
| 2–3 | −4 |
| 4–5 | −3 |
| 6–7 | −2 |
| 8–9 | −1 |
| 10–11 | +0 |
| 12–13 | +1 |
| 14–15 | +2 |
| 16–17 | +3 |
| 18–19 | +4 |
| 20–21 | +5 |
| 22–23 | +6 |
| 24–25 | +7 |
