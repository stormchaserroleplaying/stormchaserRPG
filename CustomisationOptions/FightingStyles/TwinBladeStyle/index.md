# Twin-Blade

## Style
You are skilled at fighting with double-bladed weapons. While wielding a weapon with the double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Double-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of your Double-Weapon Fighting attack.
- When you attempt to shove a creature, instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, you can instead make an attack roll. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll with advantage.

## Mastery
You've mastered fighting with double-bladed weapons, using both ends to devastating effect. While wielding a weapon with the double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you roll the maximum on a weapon damage die against a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to the next attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
- You can engage in Double-Weapon Fighting even when the weapon you are wielding lacks the light property.
- Grasping a double weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
- Before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
