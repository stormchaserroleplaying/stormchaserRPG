## Recuperating
You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:
* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on defence checks against one disease or poison currently affecting you.
