# Vehicles (Land or Water)
Proficiency with land vehicles covers a wide range of options, from chariots and howdahs to wagons and carts. Proficiency with water vehicles covers anything that navigates waterways. Proficiency with vehicles grants the knowledge needed to handle vehicles of that type, along with knowledge of how to repair and maintain them.

In addition, a character proficient with water vehicles is knowledgeable about anything a professional sailor would be familiar with, such as information about the sea and islands, tying knots, and assessing weather and sea conditions.

**Arcana.** When you study a magic vehicle, this tool proficiency aids you in uncovering lore or determining how the vehicle operates.

**Investigation, Perception.** When you inspect a vehicle for clues or hidden information, your proficiency aids you in noticing things that others might miss.

**Vehicle Handling.** When piloting a vehicle, you can apply your proficiency bonus to the vehicle’s defence.
