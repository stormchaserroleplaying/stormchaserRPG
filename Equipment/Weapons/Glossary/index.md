# Weapon Table Glossary

## Cost
The cost in gold pieces of the weapon.

## Damage
The damage dealt by the weapon.

## Properties

### Ammunition
A weapon that uses ammunition can only make ranged attacks if ammunition to shoot from the weapon is available. Each time that an attack is made with the weapon, one piece of ammunition is expended. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.

Some ranged weapons can be loaded with an amount of ammunition equal to a listed value. As long as there is ammunition in the weapon, it may ignore the load property.

After battle, half of the expended ammunition can be recovered by taking a minute to search the battlefield. This does not apply to bullets.

### Bashing
A weapon with the bashing property can also be used as a weapon with 5 foot reach, rolling the damage die shown in parenthesis.

### Brace
When a hostile creature enters the reach of a brace weapon after moving 10 feet or more, it must roll a defence check against an opportunity attack. If the creature fails the check, roll twice as many of the weapon's base damage dice.

### Brutal
A critical hit with a brutal weapons deals the listed number of additional weapon damage die.

### Caliber
Ranged weapons with the Caliber property deal additional damage when you shoot from an advantageous position. The following conditions allow you to add extra damage dice of the same damage type up to the value shown in parenthesis.
* If your target is within 15 feet distance of you, the attack deals 1 additional damage die
* For each 3 points by which you beat the target's Dexterity defence, the attack deals 1 additional damage die.

### Cleave
When a melee attack with a cleave weapon reduces a creature to 0 stamina, any excess damage from that attack can carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature is likewise reduced to 0 stamina, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 stamina. 

### Close
If the target of an attack with a close weapon is grappled, double the number of weapon dice rolled for the attack's damage.

### Concealed
Weapons with the Concealed property can be hidden from plain sight until wielded or used. You can use your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) skill to hide the weapon.

### Critical
When a critical weapon scores a critical hit, the weapon damage dice deal their maximum damage.

### Disarm
Disarm attempts made with a disarm weapon are made with advantage.

### Double
A weapon with the double property has two striking ends. Attacks with the second end use the same damage die as the primary end and follow the rules for two-weapon fighting.

### Exotic
Proficiency in an exotic weapon must be purchased individually, unless you belong to the weapon's corresponding culture.

### Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. If your Strength is less than the **Str/Dex** entry of the weapon, then you suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls with the weapon when using Dexterity in this way.

### Grappling
When you hit with a melee or thrown attack using a weapon with the Grappling property, you can spend your bonus action to attempt to grapple them. Make an attack roll vs the higher of the target's Strength and Dexterity defences. If you succeed, your weapon grapples the target. Other weapon properties (restrain, preventing, etc.) include this property and modify the grapple.

Whilst your weapon is grappling the target, any attack with the same weapon breaks the grapple. The grapple is broken if you or the target move out of reach. The grappled enemy can also spend an action and make an unarmed attack roll versus your Weapon Skill DC. If it succeeds, the weapon grapple is broken. If it is not grappled by a thrown weapon, the target can also break the weapon grapple if it succeeds in disarming you.

Whilst your weapon is grappling the target and you are holding onto your weapon, you can attempt Shove a Creature action using your Attack roll instead of Strength (Athletics).

#### Break
The weapon has Strength defence and integrity values and can be attacked with melee attacks as long as the weapon is grappling you (see grappling property). You may also be allowed a Strength check to break the weapon. Common breakable objects are:

* **Net.** Strength defence 10 and integrity 5. Immune to bludgeoning and piercing damage. Can also be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. If the Net is Barbed, you take 1d4 piercing damage breaking it.
* **Bola or Lasso.** Strength defence 10 and integrity 5. Immune to bludgeoning and piercing damage. Can also be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. 
* **Chain.** Strength defence 10 and integrity 75. Immune to piercing damage. Takes no damage from attacks dealing 10 damage or less. Can also be broken with a DC 26 Strength check. 

Once broken, weapons immediately release their grapple and, unless held by you, drop to the ground.

#### Hooked
The weapon has a hooked head that can get stuck into your opponent. Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding on your weapon, the target is unable to move away from you and can only approach you.

The target can only move away from you if it attempts to Shove you, or is Shoved away from you. If it succeeds, it also provokes an opportunity attack from you that automatically hits.

#### Ongoing
Whilst a weapon with the Ongoing property is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property), the target takes damage at the beginning of each of its turns equal to the value shown in parenthesis. 

#### Preventing
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding your weapon, the target is unable to approach you and can only move away from you. 

The target can only move towards you if it attempts to Shove you. If it succeeds, it also provokes an opportunity attack from you that automatically hits. 

#### Restraining
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see grappling weapon property), the weapon restricts some of the actions of the creature. The effect depends on the location listed in parenthesis. If more than one is listed, pick one. If none are listed, pick any one of your choice.

* **All.** The creature is restrained by your weapon.
* **Body.** The creature is restrained by your weapon, except its speed is not reduced to 0.
* **Hand.** Choose a hand. The target cannot use that hand to attack or use items (unless activated) whilst restrained.
* **Legs**. The creature is restrained by your weapon, but it doesn't suffer disadvantage to attacks. If the creature used its movement in its turn before it was hit by this attack, it also falls prone.

Whilst your weapon is restraining the creature and you are holding your weapon, on your turn you may spend an attack to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier without rolling to attack. Creatures that are formless cannot be Restrained, and some creatures may be too large to Restrain, at GM discretion.

#### Suffocating
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding your weapon, the target is also suffocating. If the target attempts to break your weapon's grapple by moving out of reach, it must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Weapon Skill DC. It can only move away from you if it succeeds on the check.

### Light
Light weapons are small and easy to handle, making them ideal for use when fighting with two weapons (see [the rules for two-weapon fighting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/MeleeAttacks/#two-weapon-fighting-)).

A light weapon can also be used effectively while the wielder is prone or supine. Creatures that attack with a light weapon while prone or supine do not suffer disadvantage on their attack roll, if they are proficient with the weapon.

### Load
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it per round, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Some weapons take longer to reload and you must spend a number of attacks to reload equal to the listed value.

### Long
Long weapons add 5 feet to your reach when you attack with them, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with them. However, long weapon attacks vs targets at a distance of 5 feet or less suffer disadvantage.

### Misfire
Whenever you make an attack roll with a ranged weapon with the misfire property and the attack roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s misfire value, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and clean or repair it. 

To repair a firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is unusable until the end of combat and may need to be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm (GM's discretion). Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire by 1.

### Mounted
Mounted weapons deal additional damage when wielded by a creature riding a mount with a speed of 40 feet or more. The target may be neither prone, nor more than one one size category smaller than your mount. If the weapon has reach or is long, the target may be prone or two size categories smaller than your mount.

When rolling damage while mounted, double the number of weapon dice. Following a mounted attack, you may continue the movement of your mount and do not provoke an opportunity attack if you leave the reach of your target, unless your attack missed.

If a mounted weapon is two-handed, then it may be wielded in one hand when mounted.

### Non-Lethal
Non-lethal weapons are designed to incapacitate a target without killing it. Weapons with this property deal their full damage when dealing non-lethal damage.

### Opportunistic
Defence checks to avoid being hit by an opportunity attack made with an opportunistic weapon are made at disadvantage.

### Parry
When wielding a parry weapon, you may use the [Parry](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Raise/) action, which grants you a bonus to your Strength defence vs melee attacks. This bonus is defined by how the weapon is wielded:

| Weapon Wielded In | Bonus to Strength Defence |
|:-----------------:|:-------------------------:|
| One Hand | +1 |
| Two Hands | +2 |

If you are wielding a finesse weapon and blocking an attack from a weapon that is being wielded in one hand, then you may use your Dexterity to calculate your Strength defence.

If you are wielding an unwieldy parry weapon and use all of your attacks when taking the attack action on your turn, then you do not benefit from the weapon's parry bonus to Strength defence until the end of your next turn.

If you are wielding a parry weapon in each hand, you only benefit from one weapon's parry bonus to your Strength defence vs melee attacks, unless you are trained in the dual wielding fighting style.

If you are wielding a bulky shield, than you cannot benefit from a parry bonus from a parry weapon in your other hand.

### Pellets
This weapon uses free ammunition, such as stones, which do not leave a trace of the direction they were shot from unless the victim is alive to notice, or the wound is inspected with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or the environment is searched with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Point Blank
Ranged weapons with the Point Blank property allow for exact precision when pointing at nearby targets. Attacks with ranged weapons that have this property do not suffer disadvantage when made within 5 feet of a hostile creature.

### Reach
The weapon has an extended length. This weapon adds 5 feet to your Reach when you attack with it, and when determining your Reach for attacks of opportunity with it.

### Sharp
When you use a sharp weapon to attack a target with 4 or less DR, you ignore DR equal to the value listed.

### Shield
This two-handed weapon may be used in one hand when combined with a shield.

### Shot
A ranged weapon with the shot property spreads multiple fragments in a cone at short range. Both the weapon and the ammunition must have the shot property.

If the target is within the normal range increment you can select a number of secondary targets within 5 feet of the primary target up to the value in parenthesis. The primary target cannot be selected as secondary target. Secondary targets behind the primary target or behind another secondary target cannot be selected. Make one attack and damage roll to apply to all targets.

If the target is within 5 feet reach instead of selecting secondary targets, the primary target takes additional damage. Roll additional damage dice equal to the listed value.

Shot attacks with this weapon do not add your ability modifier to damage unless the modifier is negative. 

### Stock
Ranged weapons with the Stock property can improve your aim when set on firm ground. 

If you lay prone (but not supine) and make a ranged attack with it, you can ignore disadvantage when shooting at long range (but no further than 1000 feet), but you suffer disadvantage if you shoot at targets within close range.

### Strength
Ranged weapons with the Strength property require raw strength to draw the string. You must have the minimum Strength score as listed in order to use them.

### Sunder
When you use a sunder weapon to attack a target with hard armour or natural armour with 7 or more DR, you ignore DR equal to the value listed.

### Tall
Attempting to shoot a tall weapon from horseback imparts disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Tangle
Tangle weapons snare implements (arms, shields, weapons) used to directly block an attack made with them when defending via Strength defence. This entangles both the weapon used to make the attack and the implement used to defend. 

Attacks with an entangled weapon suffer disadvantage on the attack roll. An entangled shield grants no bonus to Strength defence and cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks. The wielder of the entangling weapon has advantage to disarm the entangled weapon.

The creature wielding the weapon used to make the attack can disentangle it using their object interaction. If the creature wielding the implement used to defend wishes to disentangle itself, then it must spend an attack as part of the attack action and make a successful melee attack roll vs the weapon skill of the creature wielding the entangling weapon.

### Trip
Trip attempts made with a trip weapon are made with advantage.

### Tripod
Attempting to fire this weapon without a tripod imparts disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Drawing a Thrown weapon is part of the attack, but you need a free hand. You may use your bonus action to recover any Thrown weapon within your reach. At the end of combat, you can recover all undamaged Thrown weapons by taking up to a minute to search the battlefield.

When you are hit by a thrown weapon and it causes an injury, the weapon remains lodged in the target. Any time you use your action during your turn with one or several lodged weapons in you, you take 1d4 piercing damage. Removing a lodged weapon is an action.

### Two-Handed
A two-handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. When the weapon is held in two hands attempts to disarm you are made at disadvantage.

Wielding a melee weapon in two hands allows you to put more strength behind your blows. Your damage bonus increases by half (round up), as shown on the table below.

| Strength Modifier | Two-Handed Damage Bonus |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
|  +1  | +2 |
|  +2  | +3 |
|  +3  | +5 |
|  +4  | +6 |
|  +5  | +8 |
|  +6  | +9 |
|  +7  | +11 |
|  +8  | +12 |

### Unwieldy
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with unwieldy weapons. An unwieldy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

Additionally, if you take the attack action with an unwieldy weapon and use all of your attacks for that round, then hostile creatures leaving your reach do not have to make a defence check to avoid taking damage from an opportunity attack.

### Velocity
Advanced firearms shoot projectiles at a higher velocity than all other ranged weapons. While causing less bleeding than arrows, bullets deal more trauma and are very effective at killing quickly. When rolling for damage, roll one additional weapon die then remove the die with the lowest result.

When using weapons with the Velocity property the target does not benefit from any DR from armour components with the Hard property.

### Versatile
A versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. When the weapon is held in two hands attempts to disarm you are made at disadvantage.

Wielding a melee weapon in two hands allows you to put more strength behind your blows. Your damage bonus increases by 50%, as shown above on the two-handed weapon property table. Additionally, this damage bonus increases by a minimum of 1, see below:

| Strength Modifier | Two-Handed Damage Bonus |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| -5 | -4 |
| -4 | -3 |
| -3 | -2 |
| -2 | -1 |
| -1 | +0 |
| +0 | +1 |

### Vicious
Vicious weapons roll their damage die twice and take the better result.

### Volley
Weapons with the Volley property are less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are within 30 feet from you suffer disadvantage.

### Worn
A worn weapon attaches to the arm but the hand remains unoccupied.

Weapons with the worn property are equipped similarly to armour, by strapping them firmly to the body. It takes up to 1 minute to don or doff the weapon and you can do it as part of donning or doffing armour. The GM may allow you to skip the required time if you ignore the worn property of the weapon.

While the weapon benefits from the worn property, it cannot be disarmed unless the attack or skill check is a critical hit.

## Str/Dex
If your Dexterity is less than the **Str/Dex** entry of the weapon, then you suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls with the weapon. If you are wielding the weapon as a finesse weapon, then this instead applies to your Strength.

## Weight
The weight of the weapon.
