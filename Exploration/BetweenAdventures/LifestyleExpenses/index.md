# Lifestyle Expenses
Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in [Equipment](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/).

Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.
