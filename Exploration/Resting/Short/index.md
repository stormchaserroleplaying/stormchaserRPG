# Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can make up to two die rolls to recover stamina, mana or both. If you have taken a breather since the end of your last short or long rest, then you may only roll one die. 

To recover stamina, the player rolls their recovery die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character recovers stamina equal to the total (minimum of 0).

To recover mana, the player rolls their power die and adds the character's spellcasting attribute modifier to it. The character recovers mana equal to the total (minimum of 0).

At the end of the short rest, if a character has exactly 1 level of Exhaustion, then they may remove that level.
