# Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell and harmful monster ability specifies the damage that it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier (the same modifier used for the attack roll) to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts *flame strike*, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

## Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging spells and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

### Corrosive
The acid spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal corrosive damage.

### Bludgeoning
Blunt force attacks (hammers, falling and constriction) deal bludgeoning damage. When you defend with Strength defence, you have -1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage. When you defend with Dexterity defence, you have +1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage.

### Cold
The infernal chill from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

### Fire
Red dragons breathe fire and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

### Energy
Energy is pure magic focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal energy damage are spells, including *magic missile* and *spiritual weapon*.

### Electric
A *lightning bolt* spell and a blue dragon's breath deal electric damage. 

### Piercing
Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage. 

### Poison
Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage. 

### Profane
Profane damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.

### Psychic
Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage. 

### Rot


### Sacred
Sacred damage, dealt by a cleric's *flame strike* spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. 

### Slashing
Swords, axes and monsters' claws deal slashing damage. When you defend with Strength defence, you have +1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage. When you defend with Dexterity defence, you have -1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage.

### Sonic
A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the *thunderwave* spell, deals sonic damage.

## Describing The Effects Of Damage 
Game Masters describe stamina loss in different ways. When your current stamina total is half or more of your stamina maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your stamina maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 stamina strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury, or knocking you unconscious.

## Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get a bonus to the attack's damage. This can happen in two ways:

1. **More than one die in your dice pool would hit the target's defence after adding your attack modifier.** For every die, beyond the first, that hits the target's defence, roll the attack's damage dice an additionaly time. For example, if you are attacking with a maul and two of the dice in your dice pool hit the target's defence, then roll 4d6 for the damage, rather than 2d6, and then add your relevant ability modifier.

2. **One or more of the dice in your dice pool result in a natural 20.** For every die in your dice pool that rolls a natural 20, you deal your maximum possible rolled damage for a normal attack. For example, if you are attacking with a maul and one of the dice in your dice pool rolls a natural 20 (and all others would miss), then you deal 12 damage, rather than 2d6, and then add your relevant ability modifier.

These effects stack. For example:
* If you are attacking with a maul and one of the dice in your dice pool rolls a natural 20 and another would hit, then you deal 12+2d6 damage, rather than 2d6, and then add your relevant ability modifier.
* If you are attacking with a maul and three of the dice in your dice pool hit the target's defence, then roll 6d6 for the damage, rather than 2d6, and then add your relevant ability modifier.
* if you are attacking with a maul and two of the dice in your dice pool rolls a natural 20 (and all others would miss), then you deal 24 damage, rather than 2d6, and then add your relevant ability modifier.

## Massive Damage
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its stamina maximum, the attacker makes an additional attack roll with a bonus of +5 vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature suffers a random effect determined by a roll on the table below. For example, the Constitution defence of a creature that has a stamina maximum of 30 is attacked if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

| 1d10 | Effect |
|:----:|:-------|
| 1 | The creature drops to 0 stamina. |
| 2-3 | The creature drops to 0 stamina but is stable. |
| 4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks until the end of its next turn. |
