# Injuries
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. However, if a player wishes to take no stamina damage from a given attack, then they may instead check for a lingering injury.

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the injury table of the corresponding damage type. These tables assume a typical humanoid physiology, but the results can be adapted for creatures with different body types.

If you roll a 1-3 and have no more body parts of the given type to lose, or if you roll a 4-13 and have already suffered this injury, then you suffer the next worst injury on the table. If you cannot sustain any further injuries, you are dying. 

Resistance to the damage type causing the injury grants advantage on the roll. Vulnerability to the damage type causing the injury imparts disadvantage on the roll. If the roll falls within the range defined by the coverage of your armour, then you may reroll and take the better result.

Fresh injuries are at risk of festering. The first time that you take a long rest after suffering an injury, make a DC 11 Constitution defence check. If your injuries have been cleaned with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check, then you have advantage on this check. If you fail, then you suffer a festering wound in addition to your injury.

Sometimes, a character suffers from an injury that requires a period of natural healing to be removed, such as an internal injury. Days on which a character suffering from such an effect receives magical healing while at maximum stamina, count as two days for the purposes of determining the duration of such injuries.

###### Physical Injuries

| 1 | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move, unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 2 | **Lose an Arm or Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 3 | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on melee and ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you are blinded. |
| 4 | **Horrible Scar.** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar. |
| 5-7 | **Limp.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity defence check after using the Dash action. If you fail the check, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp. |
| 8-10 | **Festering Wound.** Your stamina maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your stamina maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 11-13 | **Major Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. On a failed check, you lose your action and cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing, or if you spend 10 days resting. |
| 14-16 | **Minor Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage.** This has the same effect as Major Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage above, except the DC is 10. If you already have this injury, it becomes a major injury. |
| 17-19 | **Minor Scar.** The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar. |
| 20 | **Adrenaline Rush.** Roll one hit die and add your Constitution modifier to the result. You heal that amount of stamina. If you have more than one class, use the hit die of the class in which you have more levels. If you have the same number of levels in both classes, take the greater. |

## Siege Injury
This table applies only to impaling, crushing and explosive damage from a siege weapon that dealt more than half your maximum stamina in damage and reduce you to 0 stamina. Make a simple d20 roll. Roll with advantage if the damage is impaling. Roll with disadvantage if the damage is explosive.

If the siege weapon damage deals damage of more than half your maximum stamina, but doesn't reduce you to 0 stamina, you instead roll on the physical table.
