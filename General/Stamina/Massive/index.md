# Massive Damage
You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Stamina in one blow. Similarly, when damage reduces you to 0 stamina and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your stamina maximum.

When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its stamina maximum, then the attacker makes an additional untrained attack roll with a bonus of +5 vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature suffers a random effect determined by a roll on the table below. For example, the Constitution defence of a creature that has a stamina maximum of 30 is attacked if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

| 1d10 | Effect |
|:----:|:-------|
| 1    | The creature drops to 0 stamina. |
| 2-3  | The creature drops to 0 stamina but is stable. |
| 4-5  | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7  | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks until the end of its next turn. |
