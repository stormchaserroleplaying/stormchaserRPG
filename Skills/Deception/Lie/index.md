# Lie

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Auditory, Concentrate, Linguistic, Mental, Secret*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check vs the passive [perception (INT)](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) of every creature that you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a bonus or penalty based on the situation and the nature of the lie that you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies. Some lies are so big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.

At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might later attempt an [insight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Insight/) check later to sense motive against your [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) roll to realise that it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

**Success:** The target believes your lie.

**Failure:** The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains +1d against your attempts to lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
