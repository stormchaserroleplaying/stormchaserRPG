# Lie

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Auditory, Concentrate, Linguistic, Mental, Secret*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them a bonus or penalty based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.

At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt an Insight check later to Sense Motive against your Deception roll to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

**Success:** The target believes your lie.
**Failure:** The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +1d against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
