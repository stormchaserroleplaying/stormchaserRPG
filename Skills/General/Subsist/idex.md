#### *Downtime*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Applicable Skills:** Persuasion, Survival
If you need to provide food and shelter, you can use the Subsist downtime activity. This typically uses [Persuasion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Persuasion/) if you’re in a settlement or [Survival](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Survival/) if you’re in the wild.

You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly others as well, with a standard of living. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place where you're trying to Subsist. You might need a minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange environments. Unlike most downtime activities, you can Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, but if you do, you receive a -1d penalty to your roll.

**Critical Success:** You either provide a subsistence living for yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.

**Success:** You find enough food and shelter with basic protection from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.

**Failure:** You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food and shelter.

**Critical Failure:** You attract trouble, eat something you shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week. You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you continue failing.
