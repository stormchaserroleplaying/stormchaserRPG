# Fallen Aasimar

## Ability Score Increase
Your Strength score rises by 2.

## Necrotic Shroud
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, make a proficient Charisma attack roll vs the Charisma Defence of other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you. On a hit, they become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
