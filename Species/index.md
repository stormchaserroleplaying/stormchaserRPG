# Species
In this section, you will find the species that you can choose from when building your character. Your character’s species determines their physical appearance, as well as other physical aspects like size and speed. These and all other species features stem from your character's *biology*. Keep in mind that nurture plays as much of a role in development as nature; while you may be used to seeing fantasy media portraying pastoral, friendly halflings, the culture and background that you choose can provide the stepping stones needed to create a competitive and secretive halfling wizard. You can choose only one species to gain features from.

## Age
You can choose any age for your character. Advanced age modifies your attribute scores. Age brackets vary with species. These effects are described individually and are not cumulative.

| Age Bracket | Effects |
|:-----------:|:-------:|
| Middle Age | -1 to Str, Dex or Con. +1 to Int, Wis or Cha. |
| Elderly    | -1 to two of Str, Dex and Con. +1 to two of Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |
| Venerable  | -1 to Str, Dex and Con. +1 to Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |

## Features
The description of each species includes features that are common to members of that species. For example, every species increases one or more of a character's physical attribute scores.

## Phenotype
Some species can be classified into distinct phenotypical groupings. Members of a given phenotype have all of the features of their species, along with some specific to their phenotype. Relationships between phenotypical groups vary significantly.

## Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the species. Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half of that.

## Speed
Each time that a creature spends an action (such as [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Stride/)) to move, they move their speed.

All creatures have a base speed of:

This entry modifies a creature's base speed, depending on it species.
