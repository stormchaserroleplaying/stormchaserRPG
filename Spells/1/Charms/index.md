*You shout a command that's hard to ignore.*

You speak a one-word command to a creature in range. Make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of the creature. On a hit, the creature follows the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the creature is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the creature behaves. If the creature can't follow your command, the spell ends.

For the duration, it has -1d on attack rolls vs creatures other than you, and must make a Charisma defence check vs your charms spell skill each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this check, this spell doesn’t restrict the creature's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

Make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence of one creature within range that you can see. On a hit, the creature falls [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/), becoming [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) and unable to stand up for the duration.

**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You distract a creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another.*

The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.

This spell triggers the first time a hostile creature in range succeeds on an melee or ranged attack roll, ability check or defence check, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare a specific trigger for this spell, or not to use it at all.

**Components:** V, S, M *(A pinch of fine sand, rose petals or a cricket)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

*You send creatures into a magical slumber.*

Roll 5d8; the total is the amount of Stamina that this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current Stamina (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current Stamina, each creature affected by this spell falls [Unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious) until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s current Stamina from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest Stamina. A creature’s Stamina must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) aren’t affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, roll an additional 2d8 for each point of mana above the 1st.
