# Illusion

## Color Spray
*1st Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (15-foot cone)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow and blue.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*A blinding array of colored light springs from your hand.*

Roll 6d10; the total is the amount of Stamina this spell can affect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current Stamina (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current Stamina, each creature affected by this spell is [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's Stamina from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest Stamina. A creature's Stamina must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, roll an additional 2d10 for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Disguise Self
*1st Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

*Perfect when you want to hide in plain sight.*

You make yourself - including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person - look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an [Investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check vs your illusion spell skill.

## Distort Value
*1st Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch (1-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

*Do you need to squeeze a few more gold pieces out of a merchant as you try to sell that weird octopus statue you liberated from the chaos temple? Do you need to downplay the worth of some magical assets when the tax collector stops by? Distort Value has you covered.*

You cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object’s perceived value by adding illusory flourishes or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory scratches, dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can ascertain its true value with a successful [Investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check vs your illusion spell skill.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, the maximum size of the object increases by 1 foot for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Hidden Item
*1st Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:**2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch (1-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

*You make an object invisible.*

You cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Concealment/#invisible). A creature can [Seek](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Seek/) to attempt to locate the hidden object vs your illusion spell skill.

If the item is used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed. Making a weapon invisible typically doesn't give any advantage to the attack, except that an invisible thrown weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker's hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.

**At Higher Levels.** The duration of this spell can be extended by expending additional mana: 3 mana, 8 hours; 5 mana, 24 hours; 7 mana, 10 days; 9 mana, until dispelled.

## Illusory Script
*1st Level Illusion (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** 10 Days

*You write a message and hide its true meaning.*

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature with [truesight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#truesight) can read the hidden message.

## Silent Image
*1st Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet (15-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A bit of fleece.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

*You create a large illusion with convincing movements.*

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

On subsequent turns, you can use 2 actions to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful [Investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check vs your illusion spell skill. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.
