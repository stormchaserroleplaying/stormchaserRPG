# Transmutation

## Anatomical Compatibility
*1st Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 5 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A ring of pliant material.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

A willing target’s anatomy becomes magically malleable, allowing for consensual copulation with a creature of vastly different size than it without harm. This may occur via the creature’s anatomy expanding, the other creature’s anatomy shrinking upon entering the target, or whatever effect the GM decides is appropriate; but this effect may never prevent damage or harm being taken from a hostile creature.


## Ant Haul
*1st Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

The target is considered on size category greater for the purposes of [lifting and carrying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Attributes/Strength/#lifting-and-carrying).

## Beast Shape
*1st Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A piece of the animal whose form you are taking.)*<br>
**Duration:** 10 minutes per mana expended

You magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. When the duration ends, you revert to your normal form, unless you expend further mana. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using 1 action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 stamina, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply all forms that you take:
* You retain all of your attribute scores and walking speed, though they can be modified as shown below depending on the chosen form. You also retain all your skill and defence proficiencies.
* You can't speak while in beast form. Any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
* You can’t cast spells. However, transforming doesn’t prevent you from sustaining a spell that you’ve already cast, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your talents, species, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as low-light vision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* Your gear is absorbed into your new form. Any persistent magical bonus granted by the gear still applies, however you cannot use any feature of your gear that requires you to activate it.
* When using 2 or more mana to cast this spell, all prior options still apply.

When cast using 1 mana the following apply:
* You can take the form of small- or medium-sized beast.<br>
  a. If you take the form of a small-sized beast, you gain a +2 bonus to your Dexterity score and +1 natural DR bonus.<br>
  b. If you take the form of a medium-sized beast, you gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score and a +2 natural DR bonus.
* Your form has a natural unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) - a bite, claw, horn, or other appropriate attack. Make a melee weapon attack roll using your unarmed proficiency. Choose your Dexterity or Strength bonus to add to the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, it does 1d4 (small) or 1d6 (medium) damage of an appropriate type - bludgeoning, piercing or slashing.
* Your form can have one of the following special movement speeds: burrow 5 feet, fly 20 feet, swim 30 feet, climb 30 feet. This movement must be appropriate to the chosen form. If no special movement is selected, then you can increase your walking speed by 10 feet.
* Choose one sense as a keen sense - hearing, sight or smell. You gain +1d to Perception checks using the chosen sense. Alternatively, you can choose that your form has low-light vision or darkvision to a range of 30 feet.

When cast using 2 mana the following apply:
* You can take the form of tiny- or large-sized beast.<br>
  a. If you take the form of a tiny-sized beast, you gain a +4 bonus to your Dexterity score, a -2 penalty to your Strength score and +1 natural DR bonus.<br>
  b. If you take the form of a large-sized beast, you gain a +4 bonus to your Strength score, a -2 penalty to your Dexterity score and a +4 natural DR bonus.
* The damage for your natural unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) is 1 (tiny) or 1d8 (large).

* Choose a special attack action that is appropriate to your form - [Constrict](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Constrict/), [Grab](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Grab/), [Pack Tactics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Pack/). [Poisonous](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Poisonous/), [Rake](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Rake/), [Rend](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Rend/) [Rush](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Rush/) or [Trample](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Beatiary/Abilites/Trample/).

On a hit, a creature takes 2d8 energy damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a miss, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.

Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn’t being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check vs your transmutation spell skill to pick up or move.

A creature may only be marked with only one Thaumic Sigil at a time and any subsequent Thaumic Sigil marking causes the previous sigil to vanish. This effect may only be ended by the spells [Greater Restoration]() or [Wish]().

Make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of a target within range. On a hit, the sigil is applied and they become unable to conceive children via any means.
