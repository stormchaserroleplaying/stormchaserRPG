# Evocation

## Binding Ice
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A vial of meltwater.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Make an evocation attack vs the Constitution defense of each creature in the area. On a hit, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a miss, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t hindered by ice.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional point of mana.

## Branding Smite
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

The next time that you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 sacred damage to the target, which becomes visible if it is [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/), and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can’t become [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/) until the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each additional point of mana.

## Consecrate/Desecrate
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area and are consumed.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

This spell blesses or curses an area in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point which you touch. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell:

**Consecrate.** Undead cannot be created within or summoned into the area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area suffer -1d on attack rolls and other creatures gain +1d on attack rolls to hit them.

**Desecrate.** Undead creatures created within or summoned into the area gain stamina equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area gain +1d on attack rolls and other creatures suffer -1d to hit them.

You cannot consecrate/desecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

## Darkness
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, M *(Bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.

**At Higher Levels.**  If cast using 4 or more mana, creatures with [darkvision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Special/#darkvision) can barely see through the darkness. They treat targets seen through the darkness as [concealed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Concealment/#concealed).

## Flame Blade
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A leaf of sumac.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

You evoke a fiery, scimitar-shaped blade in your free hand. While the spell lasts, you can [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with this blade. When you do so, make a melee evocation attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.**  When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d6 for every additional point of mana. 

## Force Punch
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You strike with pure magical energy.*

Make a melee evocation attack against one creature that you can see within range.

On a hit, the target takes 2d12 energy damage. If your attack roll hits the target's Strength defence, then it is pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line. The distance pushed is reduced by 5 feet for every size category the target is larger than Medium.

If the target being pushed would be moved into the space of a larger creature or a solid obstacle, its movement stops and it falls prone if your attack roll hit its Dexterity defence.

If the target being pushed would be moved into a creature of its own size or smaller and your attack roll hits the second creature's Dexterity defence, then that creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If your attack roll hits the second creature's Strength defence, then that creature is pushed back 5 feet as well, with the first target moving into its former space. This forced movement then ends for both creatures and both creatures fall prone if the attack hit their Dexterity defence.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d12 and the distance pushed by 5 feet for each additional point of mana.

## Gust of Wind
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A legume seed.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

For the spell's duration, a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction of your choice.

When the spell is cast, the spellcaster may choose one of two possible effects:
1. Each creature hit by the spell is pushed 15 feet away from the spellcaster in a direction following the line.
2. Each creature hit by the spell is pushed 10 feet away from the spellcaster in a direction following the line and falls prone after being moved in this way.

When the spell is first cast, make an evocation spell attack roll vs the Strength defence of each creature in the line. Each creature hit is subject to the effects of the spell.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to the spellcaster.

The gust disperses gas or vapour, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, as part of the action to [sustain](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/Casting/Duration/#sustaining-spells) the spell, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from them.

## Moonbeam
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Fet (5-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When the spell is first cast and at the end of each of your turns for the spell's duration, any creature within the spell's area is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain. Make an evocation attack vs the Constitution defence of each creature inside the area. On a hit, it takes 2d12 sacred damage, or half as much damage on a miss. Additionally, any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn must also make a Constitution defence check vs your evocation spell skill. It takes 2d10 sacred damage on a failed check, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You gain +1d to hit shapechangers and they make their defence check with -1d. If one is hit or fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, as part of the action to [sustain](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/Casting/Duration/#sustaining-spells) the spell, you can move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d12 for each additional point of mana.

## Scorching Ray
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a ray of heat and flame. Make an evocation attack roll against a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions. These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for scorching ray. If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 mana, the damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2-action and 3-action versions.

## Shatter
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet (10-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A chip of mica.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Make an evocation attack vs the Constitution defence of each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes 6d4 sonic damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss. You gain +1d against creatures made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana the damage increases by 2d4 for each additional point of mana.
