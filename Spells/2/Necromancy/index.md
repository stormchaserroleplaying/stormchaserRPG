# Necromancy

## Blind the Readers of This Tome
*2nd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Incense and a book.)*<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

Light incense upon a book when you cast this spell. When a creature attempts to read the contents of the book, or attempts to cast a spell that lets them do so, it must make a Constituion defence check vs your necromancy skill. On a failure, they will be blinded for 1d6 days time. 

After one creature is cursed in this manner, the book is no longer protected.

## Wither and Bloom
*2nd level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions <br>
**Range:** 60 feet (10-foot radius sphere) <br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A withered vine twisted into a loop.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke both death and life upon a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Make a necromancy attack vs the Constitution defence of each creature of your choice in that area. On a hit, each target takes 2d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a miss. Nonmagical vegetation in that area withers.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area gains Stamina equal to 1dR plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At higher levels:** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage is increased by 1d6 and the Stamina gained is increased by 1dR for each additional mana used.
