# Necromancy

## Blind the Readers of This Tome
*2nd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Incense and a book.)*<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

Light incense upon a book when you cast this spell. When a creature attempts to read the contents of the book, or attempts to cast a spell that lets them do so, it must make a Constitution defence check vs your necromancy skill. On a failure, they will be blinded for 1d6 days time. 

After one creature is cursed in this manner, the book is no longer protected.
