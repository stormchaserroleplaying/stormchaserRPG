# Warding

## Aid
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A tiny strip of white cloth.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's maximum stamina and current stamina increase by 5 for the duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell 3 or more mana, a target's stamina increases by an additional 5 for each additional point of mana.

## Arcane Lock
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Gold dust worth 25 gp, which is consumed.)*<br>
**Duration:** Until Dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures that you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken, or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting [knock]() on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, any attempt to break or [pick](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/SleightofHand/PickLock/) the object is made by a skill check vs your warding skill.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell with 3 or more mana, the DC to break a locked device increases by 1 for each additional point of mana. 

## Flash Armour
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A nude statuette or depiction.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

You touch a willing creature who is wearing neither armor nor clothing. Until the spell ends, the target may not put on armor or clothing. When they attempt to put on armor or clothing, they find it falls off of them harmlessly without the garment ever sitting upon their body. In addition, the target’s Strength and Dexterity defence vs melee and attacks becomes 10 plus the number of other creatures with an Intelligence 8 or higher that can see them, to a maximum of 18, if its typical unarmoured Dexterity defence would be lower than that.

## Let the Soul Pass
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 3 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Oils, salts and strips of linen worth 100gp which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You prepare a body making it difficult to return to the living.*

You touch the body of a deceased creature, anointing it with the ceremonial oils and salts. If, within the next 10 days, a spell is cast upon it to return it to life, the reviving caster must first succeed on a restoration check vs your warding skill for the creature to return to life.

## Pass Without Trace
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has +1d on [Stealth](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using 3 mana, the duration increases to 8 hours. If you case this spell using 4 mana, the duration increases to 24 hours.

## Safeguard Existence
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** Free Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

In a desperate maneuver, you shunt aside the worst of death’s intent and leave a creature on death’s door. Rather than dying, the creature's Stamina becomes 0, and they have the following conditions:  [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/), [unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious/) and [wounded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/Conditions/#wounded) 3.

This spell automatically triggers when a friendly creature you see within range suffers an effect that would kill it, except for when they become [dying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/Conditions/#dying) 4 from a failed recovery check. Additional exceptions can be applied on your turn, or when you roll initiative; you may declare a specific trigger for this spell, or not to use it at all.

# Touch Me Not
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

This spell charges your body with protective energy. You gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity defence vs melee and ranged attacks for the duration. In addition, an opponent that touches or grapples you takes 1d8 sacred damage plus you spellcasting attribute modifier.

This spell is purely defensive. It does not make you armed, nor can you use it to make a touch attack, though it does deal damage on any enemy with whom you grapple. An ally can touch you without taking damage. 

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using 3 mana or more, the duration increases by 1 round for each additional point of mana. 

# Warding Bond
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains +1 DR, +1d to all defences and 1 instance of [resistance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Resistance/#resistance-and-vulnerability) to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 stamina, or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell using 1 action.
