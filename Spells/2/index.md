# Level 2

# Aid
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A tiny strip of white cloth.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's maximum stamina and current stamina increase by 5 for the duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell 3 or more mana, a target's stamina increases by an additional 5 for each additional mana.

## Arcane Lock
*2nd level Ward*
**Casting Time:** 2 actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Gold dust worth 25 gp, which is consumed.)*<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures that you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken, or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting [knock]() on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, any attempt to break or pick the object is made by a skill check vs your warding skill.

## Let the Soul Pass
*2nd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 3 actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Oils, salts and strips of linen worth 100gp which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You prepare a body making it difficult to return to the living.*

You touch the body of a deceased creature, anointing it with the ceremonial oils and salts. If, within the next 10 days, a spell is cast upon it to return it to life, the reviving caster must first succeed on a restoration check vs your warding skill for the creature to return to life.

## Pass Without Trace
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell at 3rd level, you can concentrate for up to 8 hours. If you use a slot of 5th level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24 hours.

## Protection from Poisino
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature and end the [nauseated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Nauseated/) or [poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) condition on it. For the duration, the target has +1d on defence checks to avoid or end the [nauseated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Nauseated/) or [poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) conditions, and gains 1 instance of [resistance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Resistance/#resistance-and-vulnerability) to poison damage.


## Warding Bond
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to all defences, and it gains 1 instance of [resistance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Resistance/#resistance-and-vulnerability) to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 stamina or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell using 1 action.
