When you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment.

You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make a Wisdom defence check vs your charm spell skill to try to end the effect. This check gains +1d if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you.
