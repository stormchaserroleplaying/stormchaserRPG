# Divination

## Clairvoyance
*3rd level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes<br>
**Range:** 1 mile<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing worth at least 100 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.

When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. With 1 Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [See Invisibility](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/2/Divination/#see-invisibility) or [Truesight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#truesight)) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.


## From the Heaven's Eye, See Sin
*3rd level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

Stare at the sun when you cast this spell and do not look away until you wish it to end. While staring into the sun, you shall see anything that the sun could see, in any part of the world. You can see it as close as if you were 10 feet above ground. After you have looked away from the sun, you are [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) for 1d4 hours.

At night this spell has no effect, and it cannot be used indoors.

**Components:** V, M *(A miniature ziggurat)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken or signed language that it hears or sees. Moreover, when the target communicates by speaking or signing, any creature that knows at least one language can understand it if that creature can hear the speech or see the signing.
