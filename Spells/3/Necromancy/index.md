# Necromancy

## Hoarfrost Hand's Grip
*3rd level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A nettle leaf.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

*By infusing a chill into the nerves of a creature, you impart a limited numbness that inhibits their ability to accomplish precise tasks.*

Make a necromancy attack roll vs Constitution defence of a creature within range that you can see. On a hit, you may choose to selectively numb either their arms or their legs. If you choose arms, the target automatically fails any Dexterity skill checks it makes to escape restraints, has -1d on Dexterity checks that utilize the arms or hands, and halves their normal damage for weapon attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you choose legs, the target’s Speed is halved, they are knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/), and they may not stand up of their own accord. 

As an Action on your subsequent turns, you can make another necromancy attack roll vs Constitution defence. On a hit, you may numb the other body part you did not choose previously. While the target has both arms and legs numbed, its Speed becomes 0 and it also gains -1d to its Dexterity defence rolls.

## Loosen Soul
*3rd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

You work a short ceremony that loosens your soul from your body. While your soul is loosened, it can slip out of your body and move up to 30 feet away, sliding through walls or doors. You see and hear whatever is within the same area or space as your soul.
