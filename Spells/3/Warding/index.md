# Warding

## Break the Chains
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Choose a creature within range that you can see that.  The target is protected for the duration from becoming grappled or restrained. If another creature successfully grapples or restrains a target, it instead fails the attempt and the spell ends. If a target is already grappled or restrained when the spell is cast, it automatically breaks free of the grapple or restraint and the spell ends.  

In addition, after the spell ends on a target it gains a bonus to its next damage roll made to a with a melee attack equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the duration increases by 1 round for each additional mana spent.

## Dispel Magic
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make a warding check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the amount of mana that you used.

### Counterspell
As a special use of the dispel magic spell, you may attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell as a free action. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, it makes an attack roll using the spell school being cast modified by the spell's level vs your warding skill, modified by *Counterspell*'s level. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

For example, if a character with 18 intelligence who is trained in warding casts a 3rd level *Counterspell* vs a 5th level *Cone of Cold* spell cast by a Mage with 17 intelligence, then the Mage makes a trained roll with an attack bonus of:

<center>

<strong>+4 Intelligence +5 <em>Cone of Cold</em> spell level = +9 attack bonus</strong>

</center>

vs a DC of:

<center>

<strong>10 +4 Intelligence +4 training +3 <em>counterspell</em> level = DC 21</strong>

</center>

You can only *Counterspell* when another creature that you can see casts a spell within 60 feet of you. In order to be ready to *Counterspell*, you must on your own turn declare the conditions under which you will cast *Counterspell*. If you wish to upcast *counterspell* then you must declare this in advance. You may only cast *Counterspell* once per round.

The conditions must be specific. For example:
* I will *Counterspell* the first spell that the mage casts.
* I will *Counterspell* at 6th level the first evocation spell that the lich casts.
* I will *Counterspell* the first spell attempting to heal the hobgoblin warlord.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the targeted spellcaster's defence is reduced as described above.

## Exorcise the Hated Evil
*3rd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A polished opal worth at least 1000 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Make an unarmed attack roll vs a creature that is possessed or under the influence of a minor curse. On a hit, you grab the creature by the throat and press a polished opal to its forehead.

Make a warding attack roll against vs the Charisma defence of the possessing creature, or the DC of the curse. On a hit, when you pull the opal back and the curse or entity possessing the creature will exit the creature in the form of black, ichor-filled vomit. Afterwards, the creature is no longer cursed or possessed.

## Power Word: Freedom
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>

A word of your choosing is imbued with energy as you speak it. Any spell or magical effects that cause a creature of your choosing within range to be [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/), [paralyzed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Paralysed/), or to reduce their speed to 0 are ended. In addition, that creature may spend 5 feet of movement on its next turn to escape any non-magical restraints, grapple, or imprisoning device (e.g. a cage). If the target is adjacent to a hostile creature, you may teleport them to an empty space adjacent to you.
