# Warding

## Beacon of Hope
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, 1 minute

Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has +1d on Wisdom defence checks and [recovery checks](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/Recovery/) and regains the maximum number of Stamina possible from any magical healing.

## Dispel Magic
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make a warding check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the amount of mana that you used.

### Counterspell
As a special use of the dispel magic spell, you may attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell as a free action. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, it makes an attack roll using the spell school being cast modified by the spell's level vs your warding skil, modified by *Counterspell*'s level. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

For example, if a character with 18 intelligence who is trained in warding casts a 3rd level *Counterspell* vs a 5th level *Cone of Cold* spell cast by a Mage with 17 intelligence, then the Mage makes a trained roll with an attack bonus of:

<center>

<strong>+4 Intelligence +5 <em>Cone of Cold</em> spell level = +9 attack bonus</strong>

</center>

vs a DC of:

<center>

<strong>10 +4 Intelligence +4 training +3 <em>counterspell</em> level = DC 21</strong>

</center>

You can only *Counterspell* when another creature that you can see casts a spell within 60 feet of you. In order to be ready to *Counterspell*, you must on your own turn declare the conditions under which you will cast *Counterspell*. If you wish to upcast *counterspell* then you must declare this in advance. You may only cast *Counterspell* once per round.

The conditions must be specific. For example:
* I will *Counterspell* the first spell that the mage casts.
* I will *Counterspell* at 6th level the first evocation spell that the lich casts.
* I will *Counterspell* the first spell attempting to heal the hobgoblin warlord.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the targeted spellcaster's defence is reduced as described above.

## Exorcise the Hated Evil
*3rd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A polished opal worth at least 1000 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Make an unarmed attack roll vs a creature that is posessed or under the influence of a minor curse. On a hit, you grab the creature by the throat and press a polished opal to its forehead.

Make a warding attack roll against vs the Charisma defence of the posessing creature, or the DC of the curse. On a hit, when you pull the opal back and the curse or entity posessing the creature will exit the creature in the form of black, ichor-filled vomit. Afterwards, the creature is no longer cursed or possessed.

## Glyph of Warding
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 hour<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Powdered diamond worth at least 200 GP, which the spell consumes)*<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Investigation check vs your warding spell skill.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.

**Set the Trigger.** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

**Explosive Rune.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell needs to be sustained, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

**At higher levels:** The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each mana spent above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the Glyph of Warding.

## Remove Curse
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
