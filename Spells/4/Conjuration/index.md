# Conjuration

## Guardian of Faith
*4th level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space and is invulnerable, and it appears in a form appropriate for your deity or pantheon.

Any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Dexterity defence check vs your conjuration spell skill, taking 20 radiant damage on a failed check or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 5 or more mana, the total damage dealt increases by 20.

## Summon Elemental
*4th level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 90 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Air, a pebble, ash, and water inside a gold-inlaid vial worth 400+ GP)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, 1 hours

You call forth an [elemental spirit](). It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [elemental spirit]() stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Stamina or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Use the amount of mana spent for the spell’s level in the stat block.
