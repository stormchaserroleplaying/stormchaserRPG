# Divination

## Divination
*4th level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Incense worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn’t account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [long rest](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Resting/Long/), there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

## Mold the Waxen Sacrifice
*4th level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A wax figure and a lock of hair from a living creature.)*<br>
**Duration:** Special

Present a waxen figure that you have made as a part of casting this spell and affix to the figure the hair of another living creature. Whatever the figure feels so too will the living creature, though it will suffer no other ill effects from the figure's defacing. You may the manipulate the figure 10 times before this spell ends.
