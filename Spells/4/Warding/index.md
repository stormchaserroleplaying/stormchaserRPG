# Warding

## Banishment
*4th level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pentacle.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, 1 minutes

Make a ward attack vs the Charisma defence of one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the creature will be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn’t return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM’s choice) associated with its creature type.

**At Higher Levels:** When you used 5 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each additional mana.

# Death Ward
*4th level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 Stamina before the spell ends, the target instead drops to 1 Stamina, and the spell ends.

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantly without dealing damage, that effect is negated against the target, and the spell ends.


## Freedom of Movement
*4th level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A leather strap.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by [difficult terrain](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Movement/Terrain/#difficult-terrain), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s Speed nor cause the target to have the [paralyzed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Paralysed/) or [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) conditions. The target can also swim at no extra cost.

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) condition on it.

**At Higher Levels:** When you used 5 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each additional mana.
