# Warding

## Privacy
*5th level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An opaque silken veil.)*<br>
**Duration:** 10 Minutes

Donning a veil you surround yourself with a sphere of power that negates all forms of divination. Divination spells cannot perceive anything within the area. The ward does not prevent communication and movement into and out of the area. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 6 or more mana, the range becomes Self (10-foot radius), with the radius increasing by 10 feet for each additional mana spent.
