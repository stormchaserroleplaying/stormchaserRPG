Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube on ground that you can see. Make a conjuration attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the spell. On a hit, the creature takes 2d6 + your spellcasting attribute modifier fire damage. A creature must also make a Dexterity defence check vs your conjuration spell skill when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
