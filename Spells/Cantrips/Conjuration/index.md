*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You hurl a bubble of acid.*

Choose one or two targets that you can see within range. If you choose two, then they must be within 5 feet of each other. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Dexterity defence. On a hit, a target takes 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier corrosive damage.

## Create Bonfire
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

*You create a bonfire on ground.*

Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube on the ground that you can see. Make a spell attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the spell. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make a Dexterity defence check vs your conjuration spell skill when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier fire damage.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily.*

Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Constitution defence against one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d8 for the direction: 1, north; 2, northeast; 3, east; 4, southeast; 5, south; 6, southwest; 7, west; 8, northwest.

*You create a spectral, floating hand to perform various tasks.*

The hand appears at a point that you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use 2 actions to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
