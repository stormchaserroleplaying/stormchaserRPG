# Fanatic
Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are fanatics — warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. A variety of gods inspire their followers to embrace this path. In general, the gods who inspire fanatics are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

### Divine Fury

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
You can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to your martial feat die. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this talent.

### Fanatical Focus

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Divine Fury and 4 Other Barbarian Talents
The divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. Each time that you rage, you gain +1d to your defences until the first time that you are hit by an attack.

### Zealous Presence

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fanatical Focus and 7 Other Barbarian Talents
You learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain +1d on attack rolls and defenses until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Rage Beyond Death

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Zealous Presence and 10 Other Barbarian Talents
The divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you’re raging, having 0 stamina doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends and you die then only if you still have 0 stamina.
