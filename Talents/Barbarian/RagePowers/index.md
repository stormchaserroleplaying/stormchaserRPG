# Rage Powers
Any character with the [Rage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/#rage) talent can spend character points on a rage power if they meet its prerequisites. Some rage powers create supernatural effects. which extend beyond strength and skill at arms. These powers frequently call for a 'rage attack roll'. A character with the [Rage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/#rage) talent is considered trained in rage attacks, which add the character's Constitution modifier to the attack roll, rather than the character's Strength or Dexterity. A character's proficiency with rage attacks can be increased to expert and master proficiency using the same progression of character point costs and requirements as listed for [Weapon Proficiency](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Weapon/Proficiency/).

Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).

If successful, then you suppress the effect for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier.

The effect still ends after the total number of rounds have passed since it began.

This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and the second attack does not suffer from the [multiple attack penalty](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Specific/Attack/#multiple-attack-penalty).
