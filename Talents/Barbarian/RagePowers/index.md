# Rage Powers
Any character with the [Rage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/#rage) talent can spend character points on a rage power if they meet its prerequisites. Some Rage Powers create supernatural effects which extend beyond strength and skill at arms. For these Powers, it will call for a Rage Attack roll. A character with the [Rage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/#rage) talent is considered Trained, and the CON modifier is added to the dice rolled rather than STR or DEX. Proficiency for Rage Attacks can be increased to Expert and Master using the same progression costs and requirements for [Weapon Proficiency](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Weapon/Proficiency/).

Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).
