If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

When you use an invention of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this invention increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by 1d8, for each invention level above 1st.
