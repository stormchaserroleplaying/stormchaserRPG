# Gunslinger Talent Tree
With an aim as sharp as their wit, gunslingers pursue their own ends for their own reasons, beholden to no code except their own, and trusting no judgment save that learned through experience. The wild frontier breeds hard folk to hard ways, a dangerous land where life can hinge on a deal of the cards or the speed of the draw.

### Deadeye

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*In combat, you find your flow with deadly efficiency.*

Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, the lowest number you must roll on the d20 to score a critical hit with subsequent ranged weapon attacks decreases by one. You can gain this benefit multiple times, but it can’t reduce the threshold for scoring a critical hit below 16.

You lose this benefit if you miss with an attack, you become incapacitated, or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a creature since your last turn.

### Bad Medicine

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a firearm.

The number of additional dice increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Bad Medicine column of the Gunslinger table.

### Grit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
The hard-fought battles of your past have instilled in you a wellspring of resolve, which is represented by grit points. You have a number of grit points equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 point).

You can spend these points to fuel various grit features. You start knowing four such features: Buck Up, Bullet Time, Covering Fire, and Dodge Roll. You learn more grit features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a grit point, it is unavailable until you regain it. You regain 1 expended grit point whenever you score a critical hit against a hostile creature, and you regain all expended grit points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Buck Up
You can spend 1 grit point and 1 action to spend one or more Hit Dice, following the normal rules for regaining hit points using Hit Dice. The maximum number of Hit Dice you can spend each time you use this feature equals your Constitution modifier + 1.

#### Bullet Time
Spend 1 grit point. You gain +1d to your Dexterity defence vs the first ranged attack to target you before the start of your next turn. If you are not the target of a ranged attack, you regain the grit point at the start of your next turn.

#### Covering Fire
Declare a number of grit points up to your current total. Until the start of your next turn, allies within 60 feet of you gain +1d to their defences against a number of attacks equal to the number chosen. Once that number of attacks have been affected, the effect ends. 

If at the start of your next turn fewer attacks than the number declared were made, you regain that many grit points.

#### Dodge Roll
You can spend 1 grit point and 1 action to move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. You can’t take this action if your speed is 0.

### Quickdraw

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 2 Gunslinger Talents
*You're never caught unawares.*

You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, whenever you draw or stow a firearm, you can draw or stow any number of weapons as part of the same move or action.

### Lock N' Load
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Quickdraw and 4 other Gunslinger Talents
You can load or reload a firearm you are holding as part of your move or your action.

### Ace in the Hole

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Grit and 6 other Gunslinger Talents
Once per turn when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 grit point to add your Wisdom modifier to the roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

### Born Lucky

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Grit and 8 other Gunslinger Talents
When you are forced to make a saving throw, you can spend 1 grit point to gain +1d on the save.

### Frontier Justice

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Snapshot Mastery and 8 Other Gunslinger Talents
Other creatures provoke an attack of opportunity from you when they willingly move to a space within 10 feet of you and you can use ranged weapons when making attacks of opportunity.
If you can already make attacks of opportunity at range, this distance is in addition to that range.

### Skullcracker

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bad Medicine and 10 Other Gunslinger Talents
When you deal damage with a ranged weapon attack to a creature that is concentrating, you gain +1d when you roll vs the creature’s Constitution defence to make them break their concentration.. If the attack is a critical hit, the target automatically loses concentration.

### Cheat Death

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Grit and 10 other Gunslinger Talents
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can spend 1 grit point to drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you do so, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

### True Grit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Grit and 12 other Gunslinger Talents
*Cool under fire.*

When you start your turn and have no grit points remaining, you regain 1 grit point.

### True Grit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 14 Gunslinger Talents

You have +1d on ranged weapon attack rolls while the threshold for scoring a critical hit is 16 or lower.
