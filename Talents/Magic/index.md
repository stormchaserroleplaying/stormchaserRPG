# Magic Talents

## Characters with Arcane and Divine Spellcasting
If you have talents from both the arcane spellcasting talent tree and the divine spellcasting talent tree, your maximum mana is determine by the higher spell level of the two. You receive all spells known and prepared from each spellcasting type and, for each spellcasting type, you can obtain bonus spells from any one talent tree branch from which you already have talents.

For example, a character with Level 1 Arcane Spellcasting, Level 1 Divine Spellcasting and a spellcasting attribute of 18 (+4) for both would have:
* 4 arcane cantrips
* 4 arcane spells known, plus 2 bonus spells from any one talent tree branch from which the character has talents
* 4 divine cantrips
* 4 levels of divine spells prepared, plus the option to purchase 2 bonus spells from any talent tree branch from which the character has talents
* 3 mana

If the character were to increase the maximum level of either their arcane or divine spells, then they would gain the additional spells known or prepared, as well as increase their maximum mana from 3 to 6.
