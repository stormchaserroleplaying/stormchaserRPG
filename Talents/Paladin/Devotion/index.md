# Devotion 
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of Devotion 
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

* **Honesty.** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.
* **Courage** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
* **Compassion.** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.
* **Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.
* **Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

### Bonus Spells
As a devotion paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of Devotion
#### 5 character points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Sacred Weapon
As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add your spellcasting modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

#### Turn the Unholy
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead. 

Make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence of each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a hit, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Aura of Devotion
#### 15 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of Devotion and Aura of Protection
You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.

### Purity of Spirit
#### 65 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Aura of Devotion
You are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.

### Holy Nimbus
#### 50 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Purity of Spirit
You can emanate an aura of sunlight. As an action for 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have ++1d to defences vs spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
