# Redemption
The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.

While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of Redemption
The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.
* **Peace.** Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.
* **Innocence.** All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.
* **Patience.** Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.
* **Wisdom.** Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.

### Bonus Spells
As a redemption paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of Redemption
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Emissary of Peace
As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +1d bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.

#### Rebuke the Violent
Each round, the first time a hostile creature within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, the creature must make a Wisdom defence check against your spell skill. On a failed defence, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

### Aura of the Guardian
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of Redemption and Aura of Protection
If, within the last round, a creature took damage while within 10 feet of you, you can use a free action at the start of your turn to magically cause that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

### Protective Spirit
#### *Cost:* 65 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Aura of the Guardian
You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your number of paladin talents if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren't incapacitated.

### Emissary of Redemption
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Protective Spirit
You become an avatar of peace, which gives you two benefits:
* You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).
* Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.

If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.
