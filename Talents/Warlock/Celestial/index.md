# The Celestial
Your patron is a powerful being of the higher planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.

Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behaviour and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You learn the [Eldritch Blast](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Evocation/#eldritch-blast) cantrip. The damage type for this spell is sacred. You also learn the the [Light](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Evocation/#light) cantrip. These count as arcane cantrips for you. However, they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

Additionally, you gain the following bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Healing Light

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Arcane Spellcasting<br>**Actions:** 1
*You channel celestial energy to heal wounds.*

You have a pool of recovery dice that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals two times your maximum spell level.

You can heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool to grant it recovery dice. The maximum number of dice that you can spend at once is equal to your spellcasting attribute bonus (minimum of one die). Roll the dice that you spend, add them together, and restore an amount of Stamina equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Radiant Soul

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Arcane Spells and Healing Light
*Your link to the celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for sacred energy.*

You have resistance to sacred damage.

Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals sacred or fire damage, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.

###  Celestial Resilience
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Arcane Spells and Radiant Soul
*Your patron bolsters the vigour of you and your allies.*

When you finish a short or long rest, you gain temporary Stamina equal to twice your maximum spell level plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures that you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary Stamina equal to your maximum spell level plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

### Searing Vengeance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Arcane Spells and Celestial Resilience
*The radiant energy that you channel allows you to resist death.*

When you have to make a recovery check at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain Stamina equal to half your maximum stamina and can stand if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes sacred damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it is [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
