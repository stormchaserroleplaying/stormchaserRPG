# The Hexblade
You have made your pact with a mysterious entity of chaos, which manifests as a sentient, black magic weapon. Such weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with them. Many hexblade warlocks wield the weapons themselves, while others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic they the entity provides their spellcasting.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You learn the [Eldritch Blast](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Evocation/#eldritch-blast) cantrip. It does not count against the number of arcane cantrips that you know. The damage type for this spell is energy.

You gain the following bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Hex Warrior

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Arcane Spellcasting
*The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon and you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone.*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your spellcasting attribute modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon that you conjure with that feature.

**Hexblade’s Curse:** As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/). Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier vs the cursed target.
* Any attack roll that you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
* If the cursed target dies, you regain Stamina equal to twice your maximum spell level + your spellcasting attribute modifier.

You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Accursed Specter

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Arcane Spells and Hex Warrior
*You can curse the soul of a person that you slay, temporarily binding it to your service.*

When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a [specter](), the statistics for which are in the [Bestiary](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Bestiary/). When the specter appears, it gains temporary Stamina equal to your maximum spell level. The specter shares your initiative count, but acts directly after you. It obeys your verbal commands and its attack rolls are modified by your spellcasting attribute modifier.

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

###  Armour of Hexes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Arcane Spells and Accursed Specter<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll.
*Your hex grows more powerful.*

If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, it must roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack misses you, regardless of its roll.

This ability automatically triggers once per round the first time that a cursed creature hits you, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare that your Armour of Hexes will only be triggered trigger under a specific condition, or not to use it at all.

### Master of Hexes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Arcane Spells and Armor of Hexes<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature cursed by Hexblade’s Curse dies.
*You can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature.*

You can apply the curse to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, provided that you aren’t [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/). When you apply the curse in this way, you don’t regain Stamina from the death of the previously cursed creature.

At the end of each of your turns, you may declare which creature to apply the curse to, should the currently cursed creature die on another creature’s turn. Otherwise, the curse will end.
