# Conjurer ([Wizard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard))
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant. 

## Branch Features

### Conjuration Savant
The time and cost of copying conjurations to your [Spellbook](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook) is halved.

### Bonus Spells
Once you can cast spells of a given level, select two spells of that spell level from the list below as bonus spells that are added to your [Spellbook](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook), as per the [Arcane Spellcasting talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Magic/Arcane/). Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.
