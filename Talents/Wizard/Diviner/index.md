# Diviner ([Wizard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard))
The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.

## Branch Features

### Divination Savant

### Bonus Spells
Once you can cast spells of a given level, select two spells of that spell level from the list below as bonus spells known, as per the [Arcane Spellcasting talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Magic/Arcane/).

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** [Spellbook Talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook)
When you select this talent, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. These are your foretelling die. On your turn, as an Action, you can designate any creature that you can see to use one of your foretelling die on any d20 roll made by that creature on their next turn. You can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
