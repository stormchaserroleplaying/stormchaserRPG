# Warder ([Wizard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard))
The School of Warding emphasises magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial and negation, rather than positive assertion. However, you understand that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.

Called warders, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, important locations must be guarded against magical spying and portals to other planes of existence must be closed. 

## Branch Features

### Warding Savant
The time and cost of copying wards to your [Spellbook](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook) is halved.

### Bonus Spells
Once you can cast spells of a given level, select two spells of that spell level from the list below as bonus spells known, as per the [Arcane Spellcasting talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Magic/Arcane/). Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

### Arcane Ward

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** [Spellbook Talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook)
When you cast a ward of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has [Integrity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Objects/#integrity) equal to 1dP per point of mana used to cast the spell + your spellcasting attribute modifier. Whenever you would take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. This damage is calculated prior to any resistances or damage reduction affecting the warded character. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Integrity, then you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 Integrity, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast a warding spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains 1dP Integrity per point of mana used to cast the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Ward

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Arcane Ward
You gain the ability to temporarily project your ward onto another creature. On your turn, you can declare a specific creature that you can see within 30' to trigger this ability. When that creature takes damage, you cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Integrity, then the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Improved Warding

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Projected Warding
When you cast a ward that requires you to make a check as a part of casting that spell, such as [Dispel Magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#dispel-magic), you gain +1d to that check.

When you use the [Counterspell](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#counterspell) option in [Dispel Magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#dispel-magic), the enemy suffers -1d on their check vs your warding skill.

### Spell Resistance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Improved Warding
You gain +1d to your Defences vs spells that target you or include you in their area of effect. 

Furthermore, you gain 1 instance of [Resistance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Resistance/#resistance-and-vulnerability) vs damage from spells.
