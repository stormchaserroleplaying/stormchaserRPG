# Warder ([Wizard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard))
The School of Warding emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.

Called warders, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.

### Bonus Spells

See the table below for the rules on the bonus spells you gain from the [Arcane Spellcasting talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Magic/Arcane/). Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

#### Warding Savant

### Arcane Ward

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** [Spellbook Talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/#spellbook)
When you cast a warding spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has Integrity equal to twice the amount of mana used to cast the spell + your spellcasting attribute modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. This damage is calculated prior to any resistances or damage reduction affecting the warded character. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Integrity, you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 Integrity it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast a warding spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains an amount of Integrity equal to twice the amount of mana used to cast the spell.

Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Ward

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Arcane Ward
When you select this talent, you gain the ability to project your ward onto another creature temporarily. On your turn, you can declare a specific creature that you can see within 30' to trigger this ability, or not use it for the next round. When that creature takes damage, you cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 Integrity, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Improved Warding

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Projected Warding
When you cast a warding spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell, as in [Dispel Magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#dispel-magic), you gain +1d to that ability check.

When you use the [Counterspell](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#counterspell) option in [Dispel Magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/3/Warding/#dispel-magic), the enemy suffers -1d on their ability check against your warding skill.

### Spell Resistance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Improved Warding
You gain +1d to your Defences against all spells that target you or include you in their area of effect. 

Furthermore, you gain 1 instance of [Resistance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Resistance/#resistance-and-vulnerability) against damage from spells.
